Cool new features to add:

- Lines with generic names eg: `Pentecostal Church`; Should check area-name before deciding which subscribers are affected;
- Integrate payments and launch by myself if KPLC does not respond;
- Reminders: Once a notification is sent, include perhaps a configurable reminder;
